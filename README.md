This project goes over all of the fundamentals of React including:

    Components - independent and reusable parts of code
    
    JSX - JavaScript XML which allows writing HTML in React
    
    Props (proptypes, defaultprops, etc) - arguments passed into React component
    
    State (Component & App Level) - built-in React objects that contain data about the component
    
    Styling - inline styling using {{}}, styling using JavaScript Object, styling with CSS stylesheet
    
    Handling Events - determine what action is to be taken whenever an event is fired (onclick, onchange)
    
    Lists & Keys -React lists are created using JavaScript map function for looping through the elements, list keys are identifiers of the elements (ids)
    
    Forms - React form data is handled by component, data is stored in the component state, control changes by handling events (eent.target.value)
    
    Context API - allows sharing states across the entire app(or part of it) lightly and with ease
    
    HTTP Requests - HTTP requests are handled using asyncAwait fetch
