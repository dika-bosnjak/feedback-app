React application for giving feedback for the certain service.

This application allows users to add, update and delete feedbacks. 

It uses a local json-server which offers CRUD operations and local storage of the data.

This project goes over all of the fundamentals of React including:
Components - independent and reusable parts of code
JSX - JavaScript XML which allows writing HTML in React
Props (proptypes, defaultprops, etc) - arguments passed into React component
State (Component & App Level) - built-in React objects that contain data about the component
Styling - inline styling using {{}}, styling using JavaScript Object, styling with CSS stylesheet
Handling Events - determine what action is to be taken whenever an event is fired (onclick, onchange)
Lists & Keys -React lists are created using JavaScript map function for looping through the elements, list keys are identifiers of the elements (ids)
Forms - React form data is handled by component, data is stored in the component state, control changes by handling events (eent.target.value)
Context API - allows sharing states across the entire app(or part of it) lightly and with ease
HTTP Requests - HTTP requests are handled using asyncAwait fetch
